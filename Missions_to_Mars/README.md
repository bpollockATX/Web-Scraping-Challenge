# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

Notes on attached files

1. missions_to_mars.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing all of the steps to scrape Mars-related websites.
2. scrape_mars.py creates a function called def scrape() that performs all of the same scraping tasks that the Jupyter notebook does.
3. insert_data.py calls def scrape() and inserts the scraped data into MongoDB
4. app.py calls the Mongo data and injects it into HTML.
